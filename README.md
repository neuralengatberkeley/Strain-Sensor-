# Explanation of Model Developed for Axial Strain as a Function of Bend Angle:

The finger joints are modeled as a hinged joint where the leaf rotation axis is concentric with the knuckle axis.  Additionally, the interial surface of the leaf is in contact with the exterior surface of the knuckle.  The change in length of the sample is calculated from the arc length forumla. This model is presented in the image below:

However, in our autobender, the interior rotating surface of the leaf is offset from the exterior surface of the knuckle by an amount delta.  The adjusted AutoBender model is presented in the image below:

# Expected Trend for Normalized Resistance vs Axial Strain:

The plot below shows theoretical curves of normalized resistance versus axial strain for samples with varying lengths L, but identical liquid metal channel length (Lo) and cross-sectional area (A). The following trends are observed:

1.  As sample length, L, increases (assuming same liquid metal channel lengths and cross-sectional area), the slope of the curve decreases.
2.  A longer sample will experience less axial strain at a 90 degree bend angle
3.  For axial strains below approximately 40% (e.g., in human knuckle models), the relationship can be approximated as linear.
4.  As bend radius (R in this case, not r as indicated in human knuckle model image :/) increases, axial strain also increases for the same bend angle. For example, a strain sensor on a larger knuckle would experience greater axial strain compared to one on a smaller knuckle.
