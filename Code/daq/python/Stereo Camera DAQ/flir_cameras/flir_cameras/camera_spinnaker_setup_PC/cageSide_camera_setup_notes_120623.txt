Notes for camera synch debugging.
12/6/23

SpinView
    Open SpinView
    Assure correct settings.
    Hit "Play" button for both cameras.

    Regarding correct settings:
        Camera settings should be loading from a saved configuration.
        But, key debugging settings that may be wrong that can cause issues:
            Menu: Image Format
                Setting: Pixel Format
                Setting: Frame Width/Height
                    (incorrectly large frames lead to bandwidths that are too high to be saved, leading to dropped frames)
            Menu: GPIO
                Settings: All trigger settings

Arduino
    If camera script is already the script uploaded to the Arduino:

    Click the "Serial Monitor" icon in the upper right-hand corner.
    Input any key to instigate connection.
    Input key to start set of triggers:
        5 for 2000 triggers
        1 for ongoing triggers
        0 for off

Anaconda Prompt
    Open script
    Hit:
        Set Folder
        Start Recording
    In this state, the program is ready to receive images it is given.
        Those images are initiated by any triggers sent to the cameras (e.g. from Arduino script, etc.)
